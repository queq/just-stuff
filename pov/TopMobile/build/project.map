    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     35
      Number with same-slice register load:     30
      Number with same-slice carry load:         5
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   162 out of   2,278    7%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       124 out of   4,556    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          432
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           145 out of     432   33%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  29 out of     432    6%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              99 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
