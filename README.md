============

Personal/Uni Projects repo. If you ever come by, you're so welcome to clone this repo! (Although I don't assure every code is fully written)

Changelog:

## Wed Jun 5: 
* Added POV latest folder, which I'm currently working on.
* Some MSP430 code (using IAR Embedded Workbench) included; like timers, LED sequences, serial-parallel data transfer, edge detection module, among other simple applications. Partially developed code is included, as well as 'blank' templates.
* A little Python I've worked on NM class. Inside it you'll find a script which solves a homework about equation solving (although it's easily modifiable to use other functions and intervals). It's also included a script for curve adjusting, using Lagrange method. Finally there's an IPython notebook regarding curve adjusting.

## Fri Jun 7:
* Added the second NM Lab, about interpolation. That code is pretty sketchy
* Some files moved from their folders
